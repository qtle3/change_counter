# Change Counter Program

## Overview

This program calculates the total dollar value of a collection of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. The user inputs the count of each coin type, and the program computes and displays the total value in dollars.

### Key Concepts

- **User Input:** The program uses `input()` to read the number of each type of coin from the user.
- **Data Conversion:** The program converts the input strings to integers using `int()`.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** The program calculates the total dollar value by multiplying the count of each coin by its value and summing the results.
- **Formatted Output:** The program uses `print()` to display the total value in a readable format.
